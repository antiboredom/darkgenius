    <p><span class="annotate" data-effect="bg" data-params="[cat.jpg]">AdWeek Magazine</span> just named New York magazine its Magazine of the Year. New York magazine printed their November issue with a Barbara Kruger-designed cover showing Donald Trump’s face with <span style="background:red;color:#fff;padding:0.2em 0.4em;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:sans-serif;">LOSER</span> over it in her iconic red and white. <span class="annotate" data-effect="cursorImage" data-params="yes_cursor.gif">AdWeek’s</span> verdict: New York had a “field day” with Trump, in addition to “setting the pace with digital” and “<span class="rainbow">buzzworthy content</span>.” The Hottest Thought Leader, however, was the New Yorker, which “stood out with memorable covers and a first-person account from Donald Trump’s ghostwriter.” Time won commendation too for its covers, depicting our current president in various states of campaign meltdown. “For magazines, Donald Trump paid off handsomely in 2016,” AdWeek declared.</p>
    <p><span class="annotate" data-effect="backgroundHighlight" data-params="masashi_wakui.jpg">It’s a strange</span> time, isn’t it, when the loser wins? And yet here we are: Trump is in the White House, the New Yorker is Hottest anything, and magazines everywhere are congratulating each other for cashing in on the confusion they sowed. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a publication that wasn’t humiliated by its own election narrative?</p>
    <p><span class="annotate" data-effect="popover" data-media="assets/issue.mp4" data-caption="TNI #57: Science/Fiction">Well, there is</span>. Longtime New Inquiry subscribers know which world we live in. Since <span class="skew">2009</span>, we’ve been critiquing the bourgeois press and its failure to capture the realities of the terminal stage of the rule of capital, covering debt, cops, love, and tech before magazines with bigger budgets could poach our writers. We’re concerned with building a left that doesn’t reproduce what we critique, be that the Democratic party, anti-Blackness, transmisogyny, settler colonialism, or liberal optimism.</p>
    <p>As such we don’t talk about organizing “the white working class” or reforming the police, prisons, and the state. In this moment, as the liberal gasps for air and moans “Russia!”, the very least we can do is cross our arms and refuse to resuscitate. We don’t want a kinder, gentler cishetero patriarch or a more redistributive fascist government. Prisons are for burning, and we want to dance together in the flames.</p>
    <p>We’ve also heard, of course, many valid questions: Why are our margins so wide? Where can I buy this in print? How do I read back issues? What do I get if I’m a subscriber? How can I search the archive? We haven’t had the money to fix the site since we first started putting out the magazine in 2012. Since then, magazine apps have come and gone, the fortunes of empires have ebbed and flowed, Medium has pivoted like three times. (Fuck Medium.) Our site remained unoptimized.</p>
    <p>Until now. Thanks to the support of our readership, we are about to launch a fresh version of our website, and with it, an easier way to support us and get access to everything we’ve ever published. We’re returning to just $2 a month for subscriptions. For $2, you’ll get The <span class="annotate" data-effect="inline" data-image="assets/head.jpg">New Inquiry Magazine</span> in your inbox every month, and subscriber-only access to our complete magazine archive online. Current subscribers will automatically get their payments reduced — unless you want to buy a $10 Solidarity Subscription, which for now gets you <span class="annotate" data-effect="inline" data-image="assets/patch.png" style="filter:brightness(150%) contrast(120%);">a cool patch</span> and special discounts on merchandise, but soon we’ll be launching experimental print initiatives, new types of software-as-rhetoric, and book collections to which solidarity subscribers will get first access.</p>
    <p>$2, however, unlocks all 60 past magazine issues — an invaluable archive of radical critique from the post-crash era. Next time some reactionary asks why the left didn’t care about this or that issue when Obama was president, you’ll have an arsenal. Looking for insight on  surveillance?  Borders? <span class="annotate" data-effect="textBackground" data-image="assets/flag.gif" data-size="cover" data-color="#fff">Patriotism</span>? Free speech? Performative deidentification? The Prison Industrial Complex?  Modern Monetary Theory? Microfame and online resentment? Love and sexuality? We got you covered. <span class="annotate" data-effect="orbit" data-image="assets/thinking.png">Ever wonder if cops are people too?</span> (No.) Are you a briefcase full of money? (Yes, but which one?) Isn’t it bad to destroy art? (Sometimes!) What a dick is anyway? (¯\_(ツ)_/¯)</p>
    <p>The important thing a magazine can do, we think, is to ask the right questions—it’s right there in our name. How can we produce the space, time, and material security for Black women begin to heal from the ongoing trauma of the middle passage? Does trans liberation require the proliferation of an infinity of genders or the abolition of all gender, and, in this instance, do infinite and zero genders have the same effect? What will we do with all these skyscrapers and condos once we’ve guillotined the bourgeoisie and overthrown the regime of labor and the commodity?</p>
    <p>We’re living in a historically unstable moment, a period of revolution and counterrevolution, of consolidation and collapse. The forces of capital which had appeared to neutralize the liberation movements of a previous generation are finding themselves incapable of holding us back without recourse to the most bald and violent exertions of force. Join us as we bring those energies to bear on the organs of the media whose role it is to safeguard the ruling-class ideas. For only $2 a month, <span class="annotate" data-effect="textBackground" data-image="assets/fire.gif">you have nothing to lose but your change.</span></p>
